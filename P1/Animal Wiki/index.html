	<h2 id ="About"> About the Mantis Shrimp </h2>
		
		<p> 
			<br>
			Mantis shrimps, or stomatopods, are marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda. Some species have specialised calcified “clubs” that can strike with great power, while others have sharp forelimbs used to capture prey. They branched from other members of the class Malacostraca around 410 million years ago. Mantis shrimps typically grow to around 10 cm (3.9 in) in length. A few can reach up to 38 cm (15 in). The largest mantis shrimp ever caught had a length of 46 cm (18 in); it was caught in the Indian River near Fort Pierce, Florida, in the United States.A mantis shrimp’s carapace (the bony, thick shell that covers crustaceans and some other species) covers only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. Varieties range from shades of brown to vivid colors, as more than 450 species of mantis shrimps are known. They are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and subtropical marine habitats. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood, as many species spend most of their lives tucked away in burrows and holes.
		</p>

		<p>
			Called “sea locusts” by ancient Assyrians, “prawn killers” in Australia, and now sometimes referred to as “thumb splitters”—because of the animal’s ability to inflict painful gashes if handled incautiously—mantis shrimps have powerful claws that are used to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning, or dismembering.
			<br> <br>
		</p>

	<h2 id="Bio">Biology </h2>
		

		<p>
			The mantis shrimp’s second pair of thoracic appendages has been adapted for powerful close-range combat with high modifications. The appendage differences divide mantis shrimp into two main types: those that hunt by impaling their prey with spear-like structures and those that smash prey with a powerful blow from a heavily mineralised club-like appendage. A considerable amount of damage can be inflicted after impact with these robust, hammer-like claws. This club is further divided into three subregions: the impact region, the periodic region, and the striated region. Mantis shrimp are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the type of claws they possess:
		</p>
		<br>

	<h3 id="claws"> Claws </h3>
		<p>
			Smashers possess a much more developed club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to bludgeon and smash their meals apart. The inner aspect of the terminal portion of the appendage can also possess a sharp edge, used to cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims.
		</p>
		<p>
			Spearers are armed with spiny appendages topped with barbed tips, used to stab and snag prey.
		</p>

		<p>
			Both types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their raptorial claws at the prey, and can inflict serious damage on victims significantly greater in size than themselves. In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, with an acceleration of 10,400 g (102,000 m/s2 or 335,000 ft/s2) and speeds of 23 m/s (83 km/h; 51 mph) from a standing start. Because they strike so rapidly, they generate vapor-filled bubbles in the water between the appendage and the striking surface—known as cavitation bubbles. The collapse of these cavitation bubbles produces measurable forces on their prey in addition to the instantaneous forces of 1,500 newtons that are caused by the impact of the appendage against the striking surface, which means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike; first by the claw and then by the collapsing cavitation bubbles that immediately follow.  Even if the initial strike misses the prey, the resulting shock wave can be enough to stun or kill.

		</p>
		<br>
	<h3 id="eyes"> Eyes </h3>
		<p>
			The eyes of the mantis shrimp are mounted on mobile stalks and can move independently of each other. They are thought to have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and have the most complex visual system ever discovered.  Compared to the three types of photoreceptor cells that humans possess in their eyes, the eyes of a mantis shrimp have between 12 and 16 types of photoreceptors cells. Furthermore, some of these shrimp can tune the sensitivity of their long-wavelength colour vision to adapt to their environment. This phenomenon, called “spectral tuning”, is species-specific.  Cheroske et al. did not observe spectral tuning in Neogonodactylus oerstedii, the species with the most monotonous natural photic environment. In N. bredini, a species with a variety of habitats ranging from a depth of 5 to 10 m (although it can be found down to 20 m below the surface), spectral tuning was observed, but the ability to alter wavelengths of maximum absorbance was not as pronounced as in N. wennerae, a species with much higher ecological/photic habitat diversity.
			<br> <br>
		</p>

	<h2 id="Eco"> Ecology </h2>
		

		<p>
			Around 451 species of mantis shrimps have currently been discovered worldwide; all living species are in the suborder Unipeltata.
		</p>
		<p>
			These aggressive and typically solitary sea creatures spend most of their time hiding in rock formations or burrowing intricate passageways in the sea bed. They rarely exit their homes except to feed and relocate, and can be active during the day, nocturnal, or active primarily at twilight, depending on the species. Unlike most crustaceans, they sometimes hunt, chase, and kill prey. Although some live in temperate seas, most species live in tropical and subtropical waters in the Indian and Pacific Oceans between eastern Africa and Hawaii.
		</p>
		<br>

		<h3 id="habitat"> Habitat </h3>

		<p>
			Mantis shrimp live in burrows where they spend the majority of their time. The two different categories of mantis shrimp – spearing and smashing – favor different locations for burrowing. The spearing species build their habitat in soft sediments and the smashing species make burrows in hard substrata or coral cavities. These two habitats are crucial for their ecology since they use burrows as sites for retreat and as locations for consuming their prey. Burrows and coral cavities are also used as sites for mating and for keeping their eggs safe. Stomatopod body size undergoes periodic growth which necessitates finding a new cavity or burrow that will fit the animal’s new diameter.  Some spearing species can modify their pre-established habitat if the burrow is made of silt or mud, which can be expanded.

		<p>
			In Japanese cuisine, the mantis shrimp species Oratosquilla oratoria, called shako, is eaten boiled as a sushi topping, and occasionally raw as sashimi.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mantis shrimps are abundant along Vietnam’s coast, known in Vietnamese as bề bề, tôm tít, or tôm tech. In regions such as Nha Trang, they are called bàn chải, named for its resemblance to a scrub brush. The shrimp can be steamed, boiled, grilled, or dried, used with pepper, salt and lime, fish sauce and tamarind, or fennel.
		</p>
		<br>

		<h3 id= "aquaria"> Aquaria </h3>

		<p> 
			Some saltwater aquarists keep stomatopods in captivity. The peacock mantis is especially colourful and desired in the trade.
		</p>
		<ul>
			While some aquarists value mantis shrimps, others consider them harmful pests, because: 
				<li>They are voracious predators, eating other desirable inhabitants of the tank. </li>
				<li> Some rock-burrowing species can do more damage to live rock than the fishkeeper would </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The live rock with mantis shrimp burrows are actually considered useful by some in the marine aquarium trade and are often collected. A piece of live rock not uncommonly conveys a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, it may feed on fish and other inhabitants, and is notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank, While there are accounts of this shrimp breaking glass tanks, they are rare and are usually the result of the shrimp being kept in too small of a tank. While stomatopods do not eat coral, smashers can damage it if they try to make a home within it.
